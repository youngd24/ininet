# INITECH Banking System - Complete Documentation

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the INITECH Banking System â€” the late-90s solution for ACH, Wires, and
a few "Special Projects" that Finance doesn't ask about.

This build is for demonstration purposes only at Vintage Computer Fest.
No real money moves, but a lot of fictional pennies might.

**NEW IN THIS VERSION**: Modular architecture, Milton's Stapler Quest, and enhanced Office Space easter eggs!

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* Operating System: Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7) **OR** Ubuntu 24+
* Shell: `/usr/bin/sh` (POSIX compliant) - **UPDATED for cross-platform compatibility**
* UI: dialog 1.0+ (with fallback text menus)
* Disk Space: 5MB (plus 10MB for "document imaging" that's really text files)
* Human Factors:
  * 1 bored sysadmin
  * 1 middle manager who says "Yeahhhhâ€¦" a lot
  * 1 Milton who's very protective of his red Swingline stapler

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
   /export/banking

## OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Start
1. **Run the main application**: `./initech_bank_mvp_modular.sh`
2. **Access Special Projects**: Enter "TPS" as access code
3. **Try the Easter Egg**: Enter "Milton" as access code for the stapler quest

### VCF Control Panel
Run the VCF Control Panel for demonstrations:

```bash
./control/vcf_control.sh
```

Options include:
* **Reset to Baseline** â€“ wipe all traces of shenanigans, reseed cast & data
* **Seed Baseline** â€“ add default customers (Peter, Samir, Milton, etc.)
* **Run Demo Tour** â€“ pre-load jokes, suspicious logs, and a fake wire
* **Launch INITECH TUI** â€“ main menu for banking ops
* **View Audit Log** â€“ see what Compliance will yell about

## SPECIAL ACCESS CODES - ENHANCED

* **"TPS"** â†’ Unlocks Special Projects menu for rounding-error skims
* **"Milton"** â†’ ðŸŽ¯ **NEW**: Direct access to Milton's Stapler Quest!
* **"911"** (wire amount) â†’ Milton panic mode: locks down the terminal

## NEW FEATURES - WHAT'S CHANGED

### 1. Milton's Red Swingline Stapler Quest
**Access**: Enter "Milton" as access code at startup
**What it does**: Interactive quest to find Milton's missing stapler
**Locations to search**:
- ACH Processing Department
- Wire Transfer Office  
- Compliance & Risk
- Customer Service
- Back Office Operations
- **The Basement** (where it's actually hidden!)
- Lumbergh's Office

**Rewards**: 
- Office Space Mode unlocked
- Random themed error messages throughout the system
- Milton stops threatening to burn the building down

### 2. Office Space Mode
**Triggered by**: Completing the stapler quest
**Features**:
- Paper jam errors mention the red Swingline stapler
- TPS report errors with classic Office Space dialogue
- Milton quotes in compliance messages
- 1 in 20 chance for themed errors after quest completion

### 3. Enhanced Special Projects Menu
**New option**: "Reset Stapler Quest State" - clears quest completion for replay
**Purpose**: Allow multiple VCF attendees to experience the easter egg
**Safety**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental resets

### 4. Modular Architecture Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each function in its own module
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested separately
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features
- **Cross-Platform**: Better compatibility between Solaris and Ubuntu

## COMPLIANCE NOTES

* OFAC checks are manual. Keep a paper list.
* CTR filing done with actual pens.
* Any resemblance to real banks is purely coincidentalâ€¦ except the funny parts.
* **NEW**: Milton's stapler quest state is logged for audit purposes

## EASTER EGGS & KNOWN "FEATURES"

### Classic Easter Eggs
* PC LOAD LETTER LLC â€“ escrow account & frequent payee
* TPS Consulting LLC â€“ recipient of fractions-of-a-cent skims
* Signature cards feature faint red stapler imprints

### NEW Easter Eggs
* **Milton's Stapler Quest**: Complete interactive adventure
* **Office Space Mode**: Themed error messages and dialogue
* **Quest State Management**: Persistent progress tracking
* **Enhanced Logging**: Easter egg activities logged with special categories

## TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Shell**: Now uses `/usr/bin/sh` instead of bash-specific features
- **Utilities**: Fallback mechanisms for Solaris vs Ubuntu differences
- **Testing**: Dedicated test scripts for each platform

### State Management
- **Quest Progress**: Stored in `/export/banking/special_projects/stapler_found.flag`
- **Logging**: Enhanced logging with `EASTER_EGG` category
- **Persistence**: Quest completion persists across sessions

### Error Handling
- **Office Space Integration**: Context-aware error messages
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages about what's happening
