BACK-OFFICE OPERATIONS MANUAL – VCF Edition (09/1999)

*** INTERNAL USE ONLY – DO NOT LET MILTON SEE THIS ***
--------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to INITECH’s flagship banking operations system.
If you are reading this, congratulations: you have either
(a) been entrusted with the financial backbone of our
company, or (b) wandered in here by accident looking for
the break room. Either way, don’t touch anything… unless
you know what you’re doing. (You don’t.)

CORE MODULES
------------
1. Customer & Account Management
   - Because people like to know where their money is.
   - And sometimes, where it went.

2. Payments (ACH + Wires)
   - Move funds quickly and "securely".
   - For external wires, be sure to charge "expedite fees"
     whether or not we expedite.

3. Account Info & Statements
   - Balance inquiries, transaction histories.
   - Pro tip: If a customer notices fractions of cents
     missing, pretend it’s a “rounding adjustment fee.”

4. Fraud, Risk & Compliance
   - Report anything suspicious… except *that* project.
   - If Bill Lumbergh asks about “Special Projects,” smile
     and say you’ll “circle back.”

SPECIAL PROJECTS (UNLOCK CODE: TPS)
-----------------------------------
Our innovative "Rounding Error Optimization Initiative"
(aka "The Scheme") is strictly confidential. In short:
- All transaction amounts are rounded *up* to the nearest
  cent.
- Excess fractions are diverted to Account #7337 (shh).
- Peter says it’s foolproof. Peter is wrong.

SECURITY NOTES
--------------
- Login attempts are monitored. Three wrong guesses and
  you’re locked out until the next fiscal quarter.
- Milton has been known to send 911 wires to his own
  account. Ignore them.
- Michael Bolton is *not* the singer. Stop asking.

REMINDERS
---------
- All employees must submit TPS reports weekly.
- All TPS reports must have a cover sheet.
- If you forget the cover sheet, Lumbergh will find you.

HAVE FUN!
---------
This is a VCF demo. Break it, hack it, just don’t tell
corporate. They hate fun.
