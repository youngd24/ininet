# INITECH Finance System - VAPID Documentation

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the INITECH Finance System — the late-90s solution for Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and vendor management that keeps the bean counters happy (or at least confused).

This system is part of the larger INITECH platform and integrates with the banking system for a complete financial management solution. Built with the same vintage computing aesthetic as the banking system, VAPID provides a comprehensive view of INITECH's financial operations.

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**VAPID** = **V**endor **A**ccounts **P**ayable **I**ntegrated **D**atabase

**What it does**: A comprehensive financial management system that handles vendor relationships, invoice processing, customer billing, and financial reporting - all through a retro terminal interface that screams "1999!"

**What's underneath**: Flat-file database system with dialog-based UI, designed for maximum compatibility with vintage computing systems.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* **Operating System**: Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7) **OR** Ubuntu 24+
* **Shell**: `/usr/local/bin/bash` (with Solaris fallbacks)
* **UI**: dialog utility for terminal-based graphical menus
* **Utilities**: awk (GNU awk preferred, with Solaris XPG4 fallback)
* **Disk Space**: 10MB for accounting databases and temporary files
* **Network**: FTP access for file uploads (if using upload tools)
* **Human Factors**: 
  * 1 accountant who still uses a 10-key calculator
  * 1 vendor who sends invoices on dot-matrix paper
  * 1 system that thinks Y2K is still a concern
