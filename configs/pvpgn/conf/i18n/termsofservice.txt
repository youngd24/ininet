You are currently connected to the INIGAME BattleNet Gaming Server (via ININET)

TERMS OF USE (a.k.a. Stuff You’ll Ignore Anyway):

INIGAME BattleNet is our online playground, built with equal parts code, duct tape, and questionable life choices. It’s not affiliated with Blizzard, your ISP, or your mom yelling at you to get off the phone line so she can make a call.

This service is provided "as-is," which means it will 100% crash right when you’re about to win. 
If that ruins your weekend… tough.

We don’t support piracy. Buy the dang games. Don’t make us add you to the Wall of Shame 
where your nickname will live forever next to "Lam3r69."

1. Information on INIGAME BattleNet
   - Everything you read or hear here is some random person’s opinion, usually typed with Dorito dust all over their keyboard. 
   - If you take strategy advice from "xxDarkMage420xx" and lose… that’s natural selection at work.

2. Disclaimer of Warranty
   - This server is powered by coffee, Surge, and the faint hum of an overworked Pentium II. 
   - It is not guaranteed to be reliable, fast, or even online when you want it. 
   - If it survives Y2K, we’ll consider that a win.

3. Limitations of Liability
   We are not responsible for:
     - Lost matches, lost sleep, or lost girlfriends/boyfriends
     - Rage quits that end in broken keyboards or smashed CRT monitors
     - Sudden drops in GPA because you spent midterms grinding ladder matches
     - Any spontaneous combustion of your Packard Bell

4. Trademarks and Legal Stuff
   - Battle.net and Blizzard Entertainment® belong to Blizzard and their army of lawyers. 
   - INIGAME BattleNet is not them. We’re the cheaper, faster, and far more sarcastic cousin they don’t talk about at reunions.

------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: Don’t cheat, don’t sue us, and if your mom picks up the phone and drops your connection, yell at her — not us.

Besides all this… frag on.
