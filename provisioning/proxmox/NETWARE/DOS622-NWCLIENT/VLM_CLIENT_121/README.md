What's here? The Netware VLM client, version 1.21, for DOS/Windows. Inside each image is the origianl .exe expanding ARJ file, those can be copied to C: or then expanded onto A: as real floppies, I just copy them to C:\INSTALL and go from there.

Additionally, the AMD PCNet ODI driver for it is here for use on Proxmox.
