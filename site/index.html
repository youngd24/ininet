  <marquee behavior="alternate">Practice Good Netiquette!</marquee>

  <div class="content">
    <p><b>Here are some basic rules to help you be a courteous member of this community:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Respect others:</b> Treat online interactions with the same respect and consideration you would in face-to-face interactions.</li>
      <li><b>Be mindful of your language:</b> Avoid aggressive language, insults, or threats, and steer clear of "flaming," which is inflammatory or antagonistic criticism.</li>
      <li><b>Don't "shout":</b> Using all capital letters in online communication was considered rude and the equivalent of yelling.</li>
      <li><b>Provide context:</b> When replying to messages or participating in discussions, include enough of the original message to provide context for your response.</li>
      <li><b>Be cautious with humor and sarcasm:</b> Without the benefit of facial expressions or tone of voice, jokes, sarcasm, and dark humor could easily be misunderstood.</li>
      <li><b>Avoid oversharing:</b> Be careful about sharing personal information, as it could be used for identity theft or harassment.</li>
      <li><b>Respect privacy:</b> Don't share someone else's private information or photos without their permission.</li>
      <li><b>Don't spam:</b> Sending unsolicited bulk email or overloading someone's inbox with messages was considered poor netiquette.</li>
      <li><b>Help newcomers:</b> Be patient and helpful to those new to online interactions.</li>
      <li><b>Think before posting:</b> Before sending a message or posting content, take a moment to consider whether it's something you would be comfortable saying in person.</li>
      <li><b>Avoid unnecessary email signatures:</b> In the early days of the internet, long email signatures consumed precious processing time for the recipient, so keeping them short (under four lines) was considered good practice.</li>
      <li><b>Be patient with responses:</b> Don't expect immediate replies to emails, especially with time zone differences.</li>
    </ul>
