Subject: hi

hi yes hello i work night shift at a call center for a dispensary and enjoy
NOT getting high on my breaks! been smoking consistently for over a decade 
and been working for my place for over 2 years now anyway over the past 
year i've NOT  been hitting whatever i have on hand at the time (usually 
vapes cuz theyre handy but occasionally a coworker smokes me NOT out) and 
coming back to work on my website (https://vacantmotel.neocities.org if u 
care....) that i created to teach myself HTML/CSS and really fell into it. 
the neocities fanbase is tiny but amazing, full of guides and templates 
and assets&links!! so i built a fun routine: come back NOT lit from last 
break (everyone is gone by then), make some green tea, put on some 
lofi/ambience/vaporwave then just zen out...a ritual i also repeated at 
home too for a while then idk, got distracted but i still update 
frequently both sober and high!

i've done other languages high too but none as fun as the web design stuff. 
at least yet, i'm still a novice in this world. pythons easy, done some 
simple game tutorials high and i love simple C stuff like Nir Lichtman on 
youtube (quick&minimal tutorials). a bit of Rust, yadda yadda and several 
attempts to learn assembly which...is a work in progresS. i also 
built&setup my first PC blunted! :D (it turned out ok!)

along my journey i met my first hacker irl! he was cool i learned a lot 
(fuzzing and SIEMs and stuff) and wouldnt ya know it, he smoked too! so 
one day we were hanging, doing dabs and talking and he said to me words 
that i live by to this day: "a true professional can get the job done no 
matter how high you are" and i was like...hey yeah, actually though! 

i have gained obscene knowledge of weed since then and can (and frequently 
do) talk about it for literal hours(its my job!)! differences in lineage, 
terpenes, parent strains, growers, seed sellers, myths and conspiracies 
and it just goes on....if youre interested in learning more, check out 
sites like https://allbud.com or find pretty much any major dispo's info 
pages or idk, ask around!  pretty warm community nowadays! much like 
computers and in life, you learn something new every day :) 

thanks for listening to me ramble, heres a parting gift:

much love,

Dear Phrack,
If reality is a simulation, would it be a simulation of the future or the 
past? If it's a simulation of the past then that means the real you is 
already dead, you died WAY before we had computers powerful enough to 
simulate everything, right? On the flipside, if this is a simulation of 
the future, then there is no guarantee that you will get born in the first 
place!
-eatscrayon 

    [ So you're saying that this email could have been sent by a computer
      simulation of you from the past, or from the future? To quote Lilly 
      Wachowski: "Fuck both of you" ]

Subject: Legal action is being taken against Michael Cera by the Bank of 
         Canada for his live TV statements

Michael Cera's secret was unexpectedly exposed during a live interview, 
leading  to a scandal.Plenty of viewers picked up on the seemingly 
"random" words he spoke and flooded the live broadcast with messages.Still, 
the unfolding events reached a critical point as the Bank of Canada 
intervened, swiftly stopping the program with an urgent demand to cease 
the live broadcast promptly.

    [ How exactly did the Bank of Canada interfere with a live broadcast? 
      Did they dress up like Max Headroom and spank each other with 
      fly swatters? If not, why? ]

Subject: Elevate Your Online Presence

Hello Team,

I hope things are well. Just thought I would let you know I noticed a 
couple of technical errors on your website phrack.org.

Being a stickler for content I noticed a couple of web content-related 
mistakes on your website that I thought I would bring to your attention. 
It is on one of the inner pages.

I have one of the digital marketers preparing a strategic plan report for 
you. I thought you might find it interesting and probably a core reason 
why your online visibility is not increasing.

Can I send the plan to you or is there someone else I should send it to?

Thanks,

    [ For a zine as old as Phrack, there are bound to be some 
      technical errors. If you think you can do it better, you should
      send a paper for the next issue!

      As for our online visibility, what is wrong with our current
      strategy? Do we need to start doing TikTok dances? Do we need more 
      videos of someone squishing colorful sand, family guy clips, or 
      subway surfer gameplay footage? Let us know! ]

Hi.

This is your last chance to prevent unpleasant consequences and save your 
reputation.
Your operating systems on every device you use to log into your emails are 
infected with a Trojan virus.
I use a multiplatform virus with a hidden VNC. It works on any operating 
system: iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows.
Thanks to the encryption, no system will detect this virus. Every day its 
signatures are cleared.
I have already copied all your personal data to my own servers.
Now I have access to your email, messengers, social networks, contact list.
So now we've met and let's get down to business.
When I was gathering information about you, I realized that you really like 
to visit porn sites.
You really like to watch adult videos and get orgasms while watching them.
I have some curious videos that were recorded from your screen.
I have edited a video that clearly shows your face and the way you watch 
porn and masturbate.
Your family and friends will have no problem recognizing you in this video. 
This video can completely destroy your reputation.
Not only can I distribute this video to your contacts and friends, but I 
can make it public for every user on the web.
I have a lot of your personal data. These are your browsing histories, 
messenger and social media correspondence, phone calls, personal photos 
and videos.
I can share every one of your secrets.
All it takes is one click of my mouse to make all the information stored 
on your device available to the public.
You understand the consequences.
It will be a real disaster.
Your life would be ruined.
I bet you want to prevent that, don't you?
It's very simple.
You need to transfer me 1300 US dollars (in bitcoin equivalent at the rate 
at the moment of funds transfer). After that, I will delete all 
information about you from my servers.
Trust me, I will not bother you again.
My bitcoin wallet for payment: 18rhW8tFJyyszgJr9yUes57nZjVP22BVu
Don't know what Bitcoin is and how to use it? Use Google.
You have 48 hours to pay.
After reading this email, the timer starts automatically.
I've already been notified that you opened this email.
No need to respond to me on this message, this email was created 
automatically and is untraceable.
There is no need to try to contact anyone for help. Bitcoin wallet is 
untraceable, so you will just waste your time.
The police and other security services won't help you either.
In each of these cases, I will post all the videos without delay.
All of your data is already copied to a cluster of my servers, so changing 
your passwords on email or social media won't help.
You have 48 hours! I hope you make the right decision.

    [ Your wallet is empty babe, better luck next time! If you want 
      to send us a paper on your multiplatform virus, we would love 
      to read it, but won't hold our breath. ]

While I understand that reverse engineers are enjoying their easy-mode
decompilers that have manifested long after the period of Hiew, while we
are lavishing in this now ubiquitous backwards-analyzing technology, we
are rotting at the terminal while our assembly muscles languish. Anti-
reversing in any sense is pretty much an aggressive "fuck you" to anyone
attempting to lift the veil. Want to analyze my binary? Fuck you, I'm
packed. Want to understand this code? Fuck you, it's obfuscated. Want to
understand what I'm importing? Fuck you, functions are hashed.

Naturally one of the more common and effective methods of slowing the
analyst down is obfuscating your code somehow. We all want to aspire to 
the heights of VMProtect, sure, but that's an extremely complex machine. 
A good "fuck you," in this case, is something that's simple to implement 
and effective at the same time.

Saying "fuck you" to the decompiler can be done with a deeper "fuck you":
attacking the graph representation that everyone is accustomed to when
outside the decompiler view. I won't bog you down with details, but long
story short, disassemblers treat the call instruction wrong: they assume
the function will return to the next instruction. That is not guaranteed.

So we can say "fuck you" to the disassemblers by rewriting all branching
instructions into a series of calls. A NASM macro file has been attached 
to help you, too, say "fuck you" in a simplified way. See a crackme called
"goldbox" on crackmes.one to see this tactic in action.
