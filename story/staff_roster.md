# INIGAME – 1999 Staff Roster

---

## Chip Lumbergh
- **Title:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO), INIGAME  
- **Username:** `clumberg`  
- **Age (1999):** Early 20s  

**Background:**  
Fresh out of college with a business degree, Chip only landed his role because his grandfather, William Lumbergh Sr., is the parent company’s owner. At first glance, he’s a frat-boy type — polos, khakis, and a habit of calling everyone “dude” — but with a secret nerd streak: he tinkers with PCs, fiddles with IRQs, and mods games at home.

**Personality:**  
- Awkwardly straddles the line between corporate boardrooms and the dev/sysadmin team.  
- Cringy attempts to be “cool” with the team (quotes *Hackers*, uses “leet” unironically).  
- Starts as “the nepotism kid” but grows into the unlikely hero of INIGAME by the story’s end.  

**Quirk:**  
Always carries a coffee mug with corny slogans like *“Synergy Happens.”* He doesn’t even drink coffee — he fills it with Surge. Teased for it constantly, but by the end, the mug becomes a badge of respect.

## Steven “Steve” Keezer
- **Title:** Director of Systems & Development, INIGAME  
- **Username:** `skeezer`  
- **Age (1999):** Early 30s  

**Background:**  
Brought in from INITECH after the fire, originally on contract, Steven became the de facto manager of admins and developers. He was chosen more out of chaos than design (Chip literally pointed at him in a meeting), but he keeps things stitched together.

**Personality:**  
- Dry, pragmatic, resilient.  
- Quietly ambitious but often wryly amused by INIGAME’s absurdity.  
- Seen as “the adult in the room,” even though he’s not much older than the team.  

**Quirk:**  
Carries a battered clipboard with Post-its neatly arranged into “Done,” “To-Do,” and “Maybe.” He taps it before making decisions — almost a nervous tic.

## Jackson “Jack” Rourke
- **Title:** Lead System & Security Engineer, INIGAME  
- **Username:** `jrourke`  
- **Age (1999):** About 30  

**Background:**  
Cut his teeth in the mid-90s at a regional ISP, juggling Solaris boxes, NetWare logins, and firewall packet filters before that was a defined job. Known for Y2K remediation and sysadmin paranoia, he’s the hands-on engineer keeping INIGAME stable.

**Personality:**  
- Frontier sysadmin mentality — part cowboy, part night-owl tinkerer.  
- Drinks Mountain Dew at 2AM while muttering about Linux taking over.  
- Believes “if you don’t watch the logs, someone else will.”  

**Quirk:**  
Obsessed with label makers. Cables, floppies, even soda cans get a neatly typed label. Claims it’s “for security,” since “nobody steals things with my name on them.”

## Casey “Cass” Alvarez
- **Title:** Lead Game Developer, INIGAME  
- **Username:** `calvarez`  
- **Age (1999):** Early 20s  

**Background:**  
Self-taught, raised on hand-me-down C64s, Amigas, and cast-off PCs. Fell into INITECH’s marketing department making “ugly brochure graphics” but was discovered by Steven after-hours working on a side-scroller demo. He pulled her into INIGAME, where she became the creative heart of dev.

**Personality:**  
- Punk aesthetic: ripped jeans, band tees, chain wallet.  
- Blunt, sarcastic, and allergic to corporate jargon.  
- Sees possibility in pixels and palettes, not in PowerPoints.  

**Quirk:**  
Defaces marketing collateral with doodles and graffiti (e.g., *“Teamwork Wins!”* → *“Teamwork Sins!”*). Calls it “art therapy.”

## Harold “Hal” Brennick
- **Title Progression:**  
  - Early: Office Assistant / Junior Admin / Coordinator  
  - Later: Operations & Vendor Relations  
  - Eventual: Director of Partnerships / Sales & Marketing Lead  
- **Username:** `hbrennick`  
- **Age (1999):** Mid-40s  

**Background:**  
Laid off by INITECH after the fire, where he worked in QA testing banking software. Old family friend of Steven’s mom, Steven gave him a catch-all role at INIGAME. Initially viewed as aloof, Hal turns out to be a natural connector with strong people skills, landing deals and smoothing vendor relationships.

**Personality:**  
- Calm, steady, patient — the “dad” figure in the office.  
- Knows corporate politics but sidesteps them instead of fighting.  
- Slowly reveals he’s the secret weapon who ensures INIGAME survives.  

**Quirk:**  
Keeps an overstuffed Rolodex, held together with rubber bands and Post-its. Prefers it over Outlook, saying, *“Computers crash. Paper doesn’t.”*

## The Interns (“The Kids”)

### Brian “Bits” Patel
- **Role:** Junior Developer (Intern)  
- **Username:** `bpatel`  
- **Age (1999):** 19  
- **Quirk:** Maintains a binder called *“Code Necromancy”* with annotated bug fixes.  

---

### Melissa “Mel” Torres
- **Role:** Junior Developer (Intern)  
- **Username:** `mtorres`  
- **Age (1999):** 20  
- **Quirk:** Covers her PC with 90s tech stickers (Winamp, ICQ, 3dfx, Napster). Claims it makes it “run cooler.”  

---

### Intern Dynamic
- **General Office Nickname:** “The Kids” (used by Steven, Chip, Jack, Hal).  
- **Cass’s Nickname for Them:** “Bits & Bytes.”  
- **Work Style:** Tireless background coders. They take assignments from Cass, nominally report to Steven, and get snacks and encouragement from Hal. The unsung engine room of INIGAME.
